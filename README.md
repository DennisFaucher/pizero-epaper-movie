## Display Rotating Movie Images on a Raspberry Pi Zero e-Paper Display

So, I was having great fun with a new Raspberry Pi Zero W plus Waveshare e-Paper display acting as a pwnagotchi (www.pwnagotchi.ai) cracking WiFi passwords. Once I realized that WPA passwords can only be cracked if A) people use simple dictionary words or B) You have lots of GPUs for a long time, I decided to repurpose the rPi Zero W. Our work holiday party was coming up, so I figured something to accent my ugly sweater would be a win. These were the steps I took to create a small device that rotates through holiday movie stills:
## Hardware
